### **OOP Summary:**

* **Classes & Objects**: A class defines a blueprint, and an object is an instance of that class.
* **Inheritance**: A class can inherit methods and properties from another class.
* **Encapsulation**: Protects access to an object's data (using private variables and getter/setter methods).
* **Polymorphism**: The ability for different objects to respond to the same method name in their own way.
* **Abstraction**: Hides implementation details and exposes only necessary parts of a class through abstract methods.
